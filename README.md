# readmegenerator

This application uses NODE JS to generate a READ ME file through asking questions in the terminal.

When you download the application, run NPM Install to get the node modules. Then you run NODE INDEX.JS to run the application.

Description

Once you have run the NPM install, and NODE index.js the user is prompted with a series of questions.

Once the user has answered the questions, a read me is generated and placed into the project. 

Credits
